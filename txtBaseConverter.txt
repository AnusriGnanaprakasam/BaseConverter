#Common Mistake #7: Creating circular module
'''I was importing '''
i was importing both files for each other
first one imported second and second imported the first
this is bad

#did not recognize basetwofunction because of variable in the other file?

The answer is that the mere presence of a circular import is not in and of itself a problem in Python. If a module
has already been imported, Python is smart enough not to try to re-import it.
However, depending on the point at which each module is attempting to access functions or variables defined in the other,
you may indeed run into problems.


IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- HOW ARE MODULES INITIALIZED? Looking at how python works what is called and taken into consideration next
- trouble with none type when trying to assign the result of a function to a var
UPDATES:
- I am just going to put the program in one file


FINAL:
- I made a base converter
- it works
- it is a small first project
- I might try to make two separate files when i want to add more stuff to it
-What should i do next?
 - Create a UI for this
